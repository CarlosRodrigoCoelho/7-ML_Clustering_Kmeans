# Spotify-recommender 🎶

- Understand how music recommendation systems works. 
- Know and use unsupervised machine-learning methods for music classification. 
- Find out what the criteria and characteristics of the songs are used for the recommendation. 
- Perform song recommender creation and connect with Spotify API. 
- Dig deeper into the Spotify API with the Spotipy library.

# 📘 Intro
Who never thought about how those songs that we listen to randomly on some music app, seem to be not so random? I've thought several times how that app knows me so well, to the point of recommending me a song that seems to be playing deep in my soul. And sometimes, it's not even just with music apps, streaming apps, or any other video app.

# 🧑‍💻 The Data
To work on the project today, I will use data from the API. There has already been a little treatment of the data.
